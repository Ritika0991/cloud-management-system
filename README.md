# Cloud Management System using libvirt API
Many popular cloud management systems and virtualization tools are built over the libvirt API. The libvirt API lets users deploy and manage the lifecycle of VMs spread over multiple physical servers, and works across a variety of backend hypervisors. I have built the autoscaling functionality that many cloud management systems provide to the cloud users. Real-life systems and cloud applications today (e.g., web servers, database servers) are built to be scalable, so that system performance can keep up with increasing load. A cloud application deployed on VMs or containers can be scaled either horizontally (by adding more replica VMs) or vertically (by increasing the resources allocated to the existing VMs). I have focused only on horizontal scaling. The scaling can be triggered in many ways, e.g., when the CPU utilization of the VMs running the application crosses a threshold. Most cloud management systems today come with some autoscaling support. When you run an application on a VM in a cloud and enable autoscaling, the cloud management system monitors the utilization of various hardware resources (CPU, memory, disk, and so on), and spawns a new instance/replica of your application node if some resource utilization crosses a threshold. I have built a simplified version of this.
